# DuckStation-UWP (ARM)
Fast PlayStation 1 emulator for Windows ARM32 (UWP)

## Compatibility 
- Windows Build (15035+)
- DirectX 11 Feature Level 10+
- DirectX 11 Feature Level 9.1 (Partially, Software render)
- Don't enable recompiler option still not working

## Performance
After few tests it worked good on `Adreno 330` but slow on `Adreno 305`

You may achieve better performance by manipulating Speed options

GPUs `Adreno 400+` are perfect and they will work with full speed.
